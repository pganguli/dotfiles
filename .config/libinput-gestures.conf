# Configuration file for libinput-gestures.
# Mark Blakeney, Sep 2015
#
# The default configuration file exists at /etc/libinput-gestures.conf
# but a user can create a personal custom configuration file at
# ~/.config/libinput-gestures.conf.
#
# Lines starting with '#' and blank lines are ignored. Currently
# "gesture" and "device" configuration keywords are supported as
# described below. The keyword can optionally be appended with a ":" (to
# maintain compatibility with original format configuration files).
#
# Each gesture line has 3 [or 4] arguments separated by whitespace:
#
# action motion [finger_count] command
#
# where action and motion is either:
#     swipe up
#     swipe down
#     swipe left
#     swipe right
#     swipe left_up
#     swipe left_down
#     swipe right_up
#     swipe right_down
#     pinch in
#     pinch out
#     pinch clockwise
#     pinch anticlockwise
#
# command is the remainder of the line and is any valid shell command +
# arguments.
#
# finger_count is a single numeric digit and is optional (and is
# typically 3 or 4). If specified then the command is executed when
# exactly that number of fingers is used in the gesture. If not
# specified then the command is executed when that gesture is executed
# with any number of fingers. Gesture lines specified with finger_count
# have priority over the same gesture specified without any
# finger_count.
#
# Typically command will be _internal, or xdotool. See "man xdotool" for
# the many things you can action with that tool. Note that unfortunately
# xdotool does not work with native Wayland clients.

# NOTE ABOUT FINGER COUNT:
# The above command will configure this command for all fingers (i.e. 3
# for 4) but to configure it for 3 fingers only, change it to:
# gesture swipe up	3 _internal ws_up
# Then you can configure something else for 4 fingers or leave 4 fingers
# unconfigured. You can configure an explicit finger count like this for
# all example commands in this configuration file.

# configurations.

# Optional extended swipe gestures, e.g. for browser tab navigation:
#
# Jump to next open browser tab
# gesture swipe right_up xdotool key control+Tab
#
# Jump to previous open browser tab
# gesture swipe left_up xdotool key control+shift+Tab
#
# Close current browser tab
# gesture swipe left_down xdotool key control+w
#
# Reopen and jump to last closed browser tab
# gesture swipe right_down xdotool key control+shift+t

# Example to change audio volume:
# Note this only works on an Xorg desktop (not Wayland).
# gesture swipe up   xdotool key XF86AudioRaiseVolume
# gesture swipe down xdotool key XF86AudioLowerVolume

# Toggle floating window
# gesture pinch in swaymsg floating toggle
# gesture pinch out swaymsg floating toggle

# Optional extended pinch gestures:
# gesture pinch clockwise <whatever command>
# gesture pinch anticlockwise <whatever command>

# This application normally determines your touchpad device
# automatically. Some users may have multiple touchpads but by default
# we use only the first one found. However, you can choose to specify
# the explicit device name to use. Run "libinput list-devices" to work
# out the name of your device (from the "Device:" field). Then add a
# device line specifying that name, e.g:
#
# device DLL0665:01 06CB:76AD Touchpad
#
# If the device name starts with a '/' then it is instead considered as
# the explicit device path although since device paths can change
# through reboots this is best to be a symlink. E.g. instead of specifying
# /dev/input/event12, you should use the corresponding full path link
# under /dev/input/by-path/ or /dev/input/by-id/.
#
# You can choose to use ALL touchpad devices by setting the device name
# to "all". E.g. Do this if you have multiple touchpads which you want
# to use in parallel. This reduces performance slightly so only set this
# if you have to.
#
# device all

# You can set a minimum travel distance threshold before swipe gestures
# are actioned using the swipe_threshold configuration command.
# Specify this value in dots. The default is 0.
# E.g. set it to 100 dots with "swipe_threshold 100".
# swipe_threshold 0

###############################################################################
# You can set a timeout on gestures from start to end. The default is
# the value commented below. It can be any value in float secs >= 0.
# 0 = no timeout. E.g. set it to 2 secs with "timeout 2".
# timeout 1.5
