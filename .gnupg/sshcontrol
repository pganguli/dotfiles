# List of allowed ssh keys.  Only keys present in this file are used
# in the SSH protocol.  The ssh-add tool may add new entries to this
# file to enable them; you may also add them manually.  Comment
# lines, like this one, as well as empty lines are ignored.  Lines do
# have a certain length limit but this is not serious limitation as
# the format of the entries is fixed and checked by gpg-agent. A
# non-comment line starts with optional white spaces, followed by the
# keygrip of the key given as 40 hex digits, optionally followed by a
# caching TTL in seconds, and another optional field for arbitrary
# flags.   Prepend the keygrip with an '!' mark to disable it.
#
# Execute the following command to list keygrips of available keys:
# $ gpg --list-keys --with-keygrip
# Only use keygrips from keys with the Authenticate [A] capability.
#
# Execute the following command to list the public part of the SSH key:
# $ gpg --export-ssh-key <key-id>
